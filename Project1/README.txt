This project aims to complete the 5 scenarios described in 'The Process Party'. 
The first 3 scenarios match the expected output. I spent many hours on scenario 4 and 5 
and wasn't able to get a complete version of it done. I went to many of the prof's 
office hours and could still not complete it.
