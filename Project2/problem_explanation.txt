Project_2 Project Explanation

In main, the threads are created and passed a struct in the fourth argument.
This struct represents an individual player (thread) and holds data that is important 
for a thread to have. 

The logic is built so that the same sport doesn't play back to back which prevents 
one sport from dominating the field. All of the threads are awakened at the same 
time so that they have equal chance to grab the field. We use mutexes like playerLock mutexField mutexGeneral and lockTryToJoinField
